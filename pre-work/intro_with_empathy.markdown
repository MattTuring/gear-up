## Gear Up Pre-Work
### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

**Directions:** Submit your Gear Up Pre-Work reflections on the pre-work google doc. 

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

* ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/)
* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_
* ["Why Aren't We More Compassionate?"](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goleman_on_compassion#t-39146), TED Talk (Daniel Goleman)
* ["Can you teach people to have empathy?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33287727), BBC (Jun 29, 2015)

#### Reflect
After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.
* What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?<p>
It has helped me in my career working with clients. A lot of times clients come to me with a request of how do you do X. Most people don’t take time to understand if from their perspective and don’t even ask what the objective is. When you ask the client what their end goal is often there are faster, easier, and cheaper solutions to achieve what they want. This results in a happier client and better overall relationship. 
</p>

* How does empathy help you build better software?<p>
Being able to design for core pain point allows your product to have a much greater chance of potential success and growth. Empathy for the end user allows you to identify the pain points that matter. Empathy can instill passion in you knowing that the products you make will ultimately better the lives of the users and knowing the problems you are solving can help people live better. A product designed without empathy is less successful over all.
</p>

* Why is empathy important for working on a team?<p>
People often have different perspectives and approaches to the same problem. When you are on deadlines and tight schedules it can be quite hard to reconcile the approach to a problem. Remaining empathic can prevent a lot of conflict in tense situation and greatly improve the working dynamic.
</p>
* Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.<p>
I offer technical support to restaurant IT teams. They reach out to us when stores have issues and typically come to me upset and frustrated. I need to let them vent, understand that they are frustrated and show empathy so we can focus on a resolution. I is important to understand they work in extermely demanding and stressful enviorments.
</p>
* When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?<p>

I have lots of empathy for people that are unskilled in a subject and are willing to learn.  I have almost no empathy for people who are unwilling to learn. It is often a frustrating experience. The way I face these scenarios now is try and explaining the benefits of them learning and hopefully they see the benefits and try. I would like to improve by getting less frustrated in these scenarios.
